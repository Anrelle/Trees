## Why did you make this application, and how does it contribute?  
I made this because making decisions can be hard sometimes. It can help me and others find fun ideas quickly. This is like a small guide to brighten someone’s day.  

## How It Works
The application uses a decision tree to help users make a choice. It interacts with the user by asking yes/no questions, leading to personalized suggestions based on their answers.

Step-by-Step Process
Start at the Root:
The program begins at the root of the decision tree with the first question:
"Do you feel tired?"

User Input:
The program prompts the user to answer yes or no for each question.

Tree Navigation:
If the user answers yes, the program follows the yes branch.

If the user answers no, it follows the no branch.

Reach a Leaf Node:
The process continues until the program reaches a leaf node, which contains a suggestion like:
"Watch a movie and relax!"

The program outputs the suggestion and exits.
